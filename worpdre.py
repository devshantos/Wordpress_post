Well, for all you frugal home owners, here are a few things you can do to help with that.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Seal All Air Leaks</h2>\n<p>A pretty common way to lower monthly costs is to lower your electricity bill. Look for any cracks in your house&#8217;s foundation where air might be seeping out from. And if you find those cracks, don&#8217;t hesitate to seal them. You can get the necessary caulking tubes at any store that sells home renovation supplies. And it&#8217;s not that hard to perform either. You could save around 100 dollars every month by doing this.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Air-Leak.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Switch To LED Light Bulbs</h2>\n<p>Light-emitting diodes, or LED lights, are a bit easier on the eyes when it comes to lighting. Not to mention, they&#8217;re better for the environment. Not only that, but they can also save you money. They last 15 to 20 times longer than the usual light bulb after all and use much less energy. The difference might not be noticeable at first, but you&#8217;ll be saving two to four dollars every day for each bulb you switch out.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/LED-Light-Bulbs.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Install Low-Flow Fixtures</h2>\n<p>Every year, thousands of gallons of water are wasted by people that haven&#8217;t switched to low-flow shower fixtures. Each person in the average household uses 7,250 gallons of water per year. But you can reduce that number by 40 percent with a low-flow shower head. A household could buy a new laptop with the leftover money they&#8217;d be saving every year.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shower-Fixture.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Adjust Your Water Heater Temperature</h2>\n<p>Reducing the amount of water you use is one way to lower costs, but you can save money by reducing the temperature of your house&#8217;s water heater too. And it won&#8217;t cost you a hot shower or bath either. Water heater&#8217;s are set to a base temperature much higher than most people would actually need. Lowering the temperature by just ten degrees will see as much as a five percent drop in your monthly hydro bill.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Water-Heater.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Keep Your Fridge Full</h2>\n<p>Before going on a long trip, a lot of people often decide to eat as much of the food in their fridge as possible, to prevent it from spoiling. However, that might not be the best way to save money. An empty fridge actually uses more power to stay chilled than a full one. Even if you don&#8217;t have the fridge stocked with food, maybe try filling it with bottles or water or even empty boxes. It might even be more cost effective to unplug it altogether after you&#8217;ve eaten all of the perishables. This could save you around 100 dollars every year.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Fridge.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Refinance Your Mortgage</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a common misconception that, once you&#8217;ve signed a mortgage, it can&#8217;t be changed. Well, they can, but the change isn&#8217;t always worth the hassle. The mortgage rates in the United States were at an almost historic low by the end of 2021. Refinancing your mortgage now could save you a lot of money in the long run.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Mortgage.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Check Your Mortgage PMI</h2>\n<p>When you sign a mortgage, a lot of the time people will just pay their monthly bills for it until they&#8217;ve fully paid it off. However, as houses are the one of the few types of property that can actually appreciate in value over time, you might reach a point where you can stop paying sooner than you expect. And when the loan-t0-value ratio changes, it may eventually fall below the 80% PMI cancellation threshold. Keep checking your home&#8217;s PMI and cancel your mortgage as soon as you get the chance.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/PMI.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Get An App For Monthly Bill Reminders</h2>\n<p>A good way to make sure you keep your bills the same and not having to pay any more is make sure you pay your bills on time. So getting an app to remind you about bill payments is the least you can do. One good app you could get is called <em>Chime</em>. It really helps simplify the confusion that can come when it comes to bill paying.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/App.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Clean Crud Off Your Refrigerator Coils</h2>\n<p>Over time, a large amount of crud can build up on the coils of your refrigerator. Not cleaning that off can at the least make your fridge&#8217;s fans work harder for the same effect. And that&#8217;ll increase your electricity bill. Worst case scenario, the fridge gets overworked and stops functioning entirely. Pick a day once a month to vacuum out the back of the fridge and wipe down the coils will save you from this fate. And it&#8217;ll save you a good couple hundred dollars at the minimum.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Refrigerator-Coils.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Don&#8217;t Rinse Dishes</h2>\n<p>Rinsing off your dishes before putting them in the dishwasher is a common occurrence. But it also wastes water. Around five gallons every two minutes in fact. Previously, dish soaps didn&#8217;t do their job when it came to cleaning. But more recently, modern-day detergents are more likely to get all those germs and grime off your dishes. If there&#8217;s really something stuck on the dish you think might get baked onto the dish, soak and scrub instead of rinsing.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Dirty-Dishes.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Recycle What You Can</h2>\n<p>Reduce, reuse, and recycle. Those are three words you probably hear pretty often. Yes, you should always put recyclables in said bin when the day comes. But, there are other things you can do with the other items around your house instead of just throwing them out. Look up some do-it-yourself guides and see what you have lying around. Then you can get at least a little bit of use out of those things before throwing them out for good. It&#8217;ll reduce waste and save you at least a little bit of your money.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Recycling.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Clear Your Vents</h2>\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter how much you use it, using your home&#8217;s central air system will eventually have its vents get blocked up. And that restricts air flow and increases your monthly bills. Clearing out your vents every few months is how you avoid this unfortunate fate. And it also keeps dust out of your home&#8217;s air.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Vents.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Unplug Unused Devices</h2>\n<p>Did you know that some appliances and plugs continue to siphon energy, even when they&#8217;re not turned on. The best way to stop that? Well, just unplug whatever device isn&#8217;t in use. Just doing that will decrease your electricity bill by ten percent. When you&#8217;re not going to be home for a while, it&#8217;s extra important to make sure to unplug everything.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Unplug.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Landscape Efficiently</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re going to be performing some landscaping or gardening, you might as well make sure everything is in position of your best interests. Just moving around trees can help out with your utility bills. Moving them out of the way of the windows will allow more natural light into your house, so you&#8217;ll feel less inclined to turn on the lights during the day. Alternatively, you can put shade-creating trees closer to windows to prevent excess heat coming through them and lower your air conditioning bill.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Landscaping.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Turn On Ceiling Fans</h2>\n<p>If you have ceiling fans, great! If you don&#8217;t, then it might be a good idea to install some. They&#8217;re an incredibly useful tool to have. When it gets warm in your house, your first instinct is often to turn on the AC. However, a ceiling fan can actually give you a similar change in temperature for a fraction of the electricity. You&#8217;ll be saving around 100 dollars a month by doing this.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Ceiling-Fan.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\"></header>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Look Into Tax Breaks</h2>\n<p>Homeowners have opportunities for tax breaks that non-homeowners might not have. There are quite a few that homeowners can qualify for. You can even get a deduction for the cost of installing solar panels. The interest paid on a mortgage is also tax deductible, which is something many homeowners simply aren&#8217;t aware of.</p>\n</header>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tax-Returns.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Turn Off Things When You&#8217;re Done With Them</h2>\n<p>Unplugging things when you&#8217;re done with them is one thing, but sometimes it might just be necessary to turn them off. Turn off the lights when you leave a room. Hit the power button on a laptop or TV remote when you&#8217;re down with that. It seems like common sense, but it isn&#8217;t common sense to everyone. You can save around $1,000 a year by just turning things off when you&#8217;re done with them.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Power-Off.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Keep Your Credit Score Good</h2>\n<p>A good way to ensure lower interest payments is to just pay your bills on time. That&#8217;s already been stated before, but it&#8217;s the best way to keep your credit score good. And the better your credit is, the easier it is to get a good mortgage. Not to mention, insurance companies will give you better rates.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Credit-Score.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Close Closet Doors</h2>\n<p>If you open it, close it. It may be common knowledge to close your doors that lead outside of the house, but what about the ones inside the home? Thermostats regulate the temperature in a home. And by leaving cabinets and closets open that space is expanded. Thus, the central system is forced to work harder than it needs to. And that leads to a higher power bill that could have been easily avoided.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Closet-Doors.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Don&#8217;t Waste Boiled Water</h2>\n<p>When you boil veggies, eggs, pasta, or anything else, don&#8217;t just throw out the water. Put it in a separate pot or some other receptacle. Then you can let it cool and use it again later. Most often, this water can be used for watering your garden or other plants. But you can also drink it yourself. But, most importantly, this reduces your water bill.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Boiled-Water.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Use Certain Apps For Cash Back</h2>\n<p>When it comes to getting cash back, one of the best apps for it is called <em>Slide</em>. It&#8217;s a home shopping app that offers users up to six percent cash back on purchases from more than 250 different brands. And preloading money into a <em>Slide </em>account using credit cards, PayPal, Google Pay, or Apple Pay will help you earn an additional one percent purchase with those funds. A debit card or BitPay can also earn you an additional two percent in cash back. If <em>Slide </em>isn&#8217;t your thing though, then you can try other apps to get money back.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cashback.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Wash Your Clothes In Cold Water</h2>\n<p>When cleaning your clothes, you may feel as though some loads should always use hot water. Well, if your goal is to save money, you might be better off using cold water. Today&#8217;s laundry detergents are strong enough to remove stains and clean clothes without hot water. At least a majority are. And if a stain&#8217;s a bit too hard to eliminate, hand washing would probably be a necessity anyway. Cold water&#8217;s also less expensive for you to use. It&#8217;ll end up saving you around 100 dollars every month.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Washing-Machine.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Collect Rainwater</h2>\n<p>This may not technically be legal everyone, so make sure to check your local laws before doing it. But recycling rainwater can really save you money on that water bill. It is free water after all. Just capture some rainwater from the gutter using a barrel. A 42-gallon barrel is enough to feed the average American&#8217;s garden for a month. And you&#8217;ll save a couple hundred dollars from doing it.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Collecting-Rainwater.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Toss A Dry Towel In The Dryer</h2>\n<p>Dryers are perhaps one of the biggest energy sinks in a household You may not necessarily be able to find an alternative in terms of convenience, but you can lower the amount of time you need to keep a dryer on. Just throw in a dry towel. The towel will absorb water and help with the drying process for your other clothes. This can shave off five minutes from every dryer load you use. And that&#8217;s around 120 dollars saved every month.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Towel-in-Dryer.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">Split Your Sponges</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;d be surprised by how much money you spend on things like garbage bags, detergents, and sponges. And they&#8217;re necessities, so you can&#8217;t exactly stop spending money on them. But, at least with sponges, there is a way to try to maximize your use of each sponge you get. Just cut it in half. That&#8217;ll double the number of sponges you have. And you don&#8217;t normally use the entire area of a sponge when cleaning something anyway. And you&#8217;ll have to throw it out when it gets too dirty anyway. This can save you around 100 dollars every year.</p>\n</header>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Sponge.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n</div>\n",

"rendered": "<p>You know the saying; &#8220;when life gives you lemons, make lemonade&#8221;. When people think of lemons, they don&#8217;t think of them as much more than just a fruit. A fruit that gives sour juice for you to drink. But, you&#8217;ll be surprised that that&#8217;s not all that this fruit&#8217;s good for. Here are a few extra uses that you can get out of a lemon.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Polish Silverware</h2>\n<p>After enough time, all silverware starts to get dull or rusted. Polishing your utensils regularly is important to prevent this. Many people use specific polishes, but there is another option. Mix together salt with some lemon juice and you&#8217;ve got a great paste that you can rub over your silverware. And after letting it sit for a few minutes, rinse off the past. Then just polish until its dry.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Silverware-Polishing.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Insect Repellent</h2>\n<p>Lemons actually make a great insect repellent. Spritzing some lemon juice around the window sills and jams prevents ants from entering the house. Although, it will have to be done more frequently. Sticking cloves into the two halves of a fresh lemon will also rid your backyard of mosquitoes.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Bug-Repellent.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Shampoo</h2>\n<p>Not only is an itchy scalp uncomfortable, but the flakes left on your shoulders can lead to some embarrassment. There are shampoos that help with dandruff, but lemons are pretty helpful too. You just need two tablespoons of lemon juice rubbed into your scalp. Then you rinse it out with water. Repeat this every time you wash your hair until the dandruff&#8217;s all gone.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Shampoo.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Antibiotics</h2>\n<p>Did you know that lemons have antibacterial properties? They&#8217;re actually pretty good at helping rid yourself of infections. You can take care of them with a combination of lemon, salt, and warm or hot water. The concoction can be used for ears and the throat. Although, for more serious infections you should probably still see a doctor.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Antibiotics.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Curing Toothaches</h2>\n<p>Do you have problems with toothaches or bleeding gums? If so, grab a lemon. The acidity and antibacterial properties of the fruit can help alleviate both when used properly. Just massage the juice in the affected area. It&#8217;ll burn, but that just means its doing its job. If its burns too much though, rinse it out as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Toothache.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Cleaning Fluid</h2>\n<p>Cleaning fluids can get pretty expensive and may also include ingredients that aren&#8217;t safe for people. But that&#8217;s why lemons are so useful. Peel lemons and mix it with some vinegar in a spray bottle, then let it sit for a night. Then just add in water to fill the bottle and shake. Now you&#8217;ve got an all-purpose cleaning spray.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cleaning-Spray.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Refresh Your Cutting Boards</h2>\n<p>Cutting boards can get many marks on them after a while of use. And the more marks they get, the more prone to gathering bacteria they are, as well as an overall shortened lifespan. However, get some lemon and salt and scrub the board with a sponge and you won&#8217;t have to worry about that anymore. Just let the lemon juice stay for 15 minutes, repeat, and rinse the board off before letting it air dry.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cutting-Board.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Brighten Whites</h2>\n<p>It can be hard to keep your white clothes looking white. Bleach is one option, but its a harsh chemical that affects the fabric&#8217;s integrity. Turns out lemons are a good alternative. Mix lemon juice with baking soda and hot water, then poor it in your washing machine. Although, you should let it sit for about 30 minutes before running your whites through a wash cycle like normal.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Washing-Machine.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Cleaning Nails</h2>\n<p>Cucumbers aren&#8217;t the only food good for luxury living. Lemons are actually really good for cleaning your nails and giving you a manicure. Just take a cup of warm water or a bowl and juice a lemon into it. The lemon will not only clean your nails but also help get you some necessary vitamins into your nail beds.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Nail-Cleaning.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Eradicating Odors</h2>\n<p>No matter what, certain areas in your house are bound to accumulate odors. Whether they be in your trash can, garage, or even fridge. Fortunately, a lemon can help alleviate those issues. There are a couple different ways you can take care of bad smells, but most often is a deep cleaning with a sponge soaked in lemon juice. You won&#8217;t even have to rinse it off once you&#8217;re done.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Eradicating-Odors.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Candles</h2>\n<p>People like the smell of candles. They also like the smell of lemons. So why not make a candle out of lemons? Cut the lemons in half and remove the fruit&#8217;s flesh. Then heat up wax from old candles and pour it into the cups you made with the lemons. Then just put in a wick and light it up. You&#8217;ve just made a nice-smelling and effective candle.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Candles.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Cleaning Your Pits</h2>\n<p>Discoloration in your armpits can be a bit of a problem. You may want to bleach it back to its original color, but aren&#8217;t sure how to go about doing that. Fortunately, there are lemons. The acid not only helps bleach your skin but also gets rid of dead skin cell. Just rub a cut lemon under your arm every day before you take a shower. Then lotion the area afterwards. You&#8217;ll notice a considerable difference after only a week.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Armpits.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Keep Light-Colored Veggies From Browning</h2>\n<p>With or without heat, lighter-colored vegetables will often brown quickly. But you can use a lemon to try to mitigate these effects. Putting a lemon juice dampened towel will help keep those vegetables, like cauliflower, from browning too soon.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Cauliflower.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Taking Care Of Cold Symptoms</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve had a sore throat or had a cold, your mother probably gave you some hot tea with honey and lemon. Well, there is a reason to that. The two ingredients together help alleviate symptoms of minor illnesses. The lemon specifically reduces phlegm and helps improve any respiratory issues. Being packed with vitamin C helps too. Its an antioxidant that helps boost the immune system.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Tea.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Preventing Kidney Stones</h2>\n<p>Kidney stones are when too many crystal-forming substances, like calcium, accumulate in the body. Ordinarily, you can pass smaller ones through peeing, even if its a little painful, but larger ones might even require surgery. They&#8217;re not fun, so it&#8217;s probably best to prevent them. Drinking water with lemon juice is a pretty good way to do that. It increases your urine&#8217;s citrate levels which will help keep everything functioning as it does normally.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Lemon-Water.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Wrinkle Care</h2>\n<p>Whether its from stress or something else, many people can get wrinkles before expected. And those wrinkles often bother people. While they may not get rid of wrinkles altogether, lemons can help decrease free radicals, which often create wrinkles. Drinking water and lemon consistently will help your body combat them. Additionally, you can create a face wash with lemon to help out with wrinkles.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Wrinkles.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Lighten Age Spots</h2>\n<p>Age spots are another skin blemish that will likely appear as you get older. A change in your skincare regiment may be necessary. But rather than spending a lot of money on certain products, just get some lemons. Rubbing a cut lemon over the age spot will help lighten its colorization. Just let the juice sit for about 15 minutes and then wash it off.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Age-Spots.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Give Yourself Highlights</h2>\n<p>Going to a salon to get highlights can be a bit of a hassle. So why not do it yourself? And for cheap too. Just juice a quarter cup&#8217;s worth of lemons and add in some water to make it a full cup. Then just rinse your hair with the mixture and sit out in the sun until your hair dries out. Depending on the look your going for, you may have to repeat the process a couple of times.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Highlights.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Moisturize The Air</h2>\n<p>The air can get dry and musty in the winter months. This is especially prevalent since you may be less able to open the doors and windows to let fresh air in. Fortunately, lemons can help out with that a bit. Fill a pot with water and add some lemon rings with other herbs and spices. Then just boil the pot on the stove before turning it down to simmer.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Air-Moisture.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Get Rid Of Stains On Marble</h2>\n<p>Being made from petrified calcium, marble can actually stain. Fortunately, lemons can help you prevent that. Cut a lemon in half and dip it in coarse salt. Then just rub the lemon over the stain vigorously. But make sure to rinse immediately after you&#8217;re done. The acid can cause damage to the marble if its exposed to it for too long.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Marble.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Soften Your Elbows</h2>\n<p>Having dry and itchy elbows isn&#8217;t just visually unappealing, but it doesn&#8217;t feel great either. Fortunately, you can actually make a paste from lemons to act as a lotion. Combine lemon juice with baking soda, then just rub it on your elbows. It&#8217;ll exfoliate your skin, but then rinse the area with water and more lemon juice. Then just rub in some olive oil and dab it dry with a soft towel.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Elbows.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Headache Relief</h2>\n<p>When you get a headache, the first thing you want is a pain reliever like Tylenol. But, regardless of what you use, you are using a drug. However, there is an herbal remedy that you can try instead. Squeezing some lemon juice into hot tea and drinking that can help alleviate the pain from a headache.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Headache.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Relieving Poison Ivy Itchiness</h2>\n<p>Every outdoorsman or woman has probably had to deal with the itchiness that is poison ivy. And it&#8217;s absolutely horrendous. Most people that are affected by it bath in calamine lotion, but you can actually use a lemon instead. Cut one and apply the juice to the affected area. It&#8217;ll sting at first, but it will eventually sooth the itching start to get rid of the rash.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Poison-Ivy.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Removing Warts</h2>\n<p>Sometimes it seems as though the only surefire way to remove a wart is through surgery. Well, it may not get rid of them, but lemons can at least help. Squeeze some of the lemon juice onto a cotton swab and dab the wart, repeating the process for about a week. The acid from the lemon will eventually dissolve the wart.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Warts.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Gardening</h2>\n<p>When it comes to fledgling gardens, lemons can make for an excellent pot for seedlings. Cut a lemon in half and squeeze out the juice and lemon seeds. Then put the seeds your looking to grow in the lemon before burying it in your chosen soil. The lemon can act as either a pot or just fertilizer if outdoors. The lemon rind makes for excellent compost for the plants.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Gardening.webp'/></figure></p>\n",

"rendered": "<p>Chasing trends can already make your wardrobe look dated, so don&#8217;t do the same thing with your house. Although, there are some other designs in houses that can automatically make them look older. They might not even be trendy to begin with. Lets look at a few examples, and maybe a few alternatives that you can try instead to make your home look nice.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Wood Paneling</h2>\n<p>Wood paneling is a common design used in ranch-style homes. But the paneling is hard enough to design around and keep fresh. You&#8217;re pretty much better off removing the paneling and slapping a new paint of coat where it once was. A superior design choice would be wainscoting. So feel free to look into that if you want to replace your wood panels.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wood-Paneling.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Greige Bathroom Tiles</span></h2>\n<p>Greige tiles. Are they beige or are they grey? Either way, they don&#8217;t look that great in your bathroom. Their texture looks rough around the edges, no matter how much you clean them. You should paint them a different color. One of the most appropriate and easiest colors to go with is a white, subway design instead.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Greige-Tiles.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Tile Countertops</span></h2>\n<p>Tile countertops were a pretty big deal in the 70s and 80s. But times have changed. They&#8217;re just incredibly difficult to clean grout out of, especially in high-traffic areas. They&#8217;re not exactly out of date or bad looking in the present, but they&#8217;ll need a lot of attention to make sure they look clean. And that goes double for white or off-white tiles.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tile-Countertops.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Carpeted Floors</span></h2>\n<p>A carpeted floor doesn&#8217;t always look bad. Some of them look great. But they&#8217;re not perfect. Some of them can even induce allergies if they&#8217;re worn enough. Those ones are best to rip up and replace. Possibly with some vinyl tile or hardwood. It&#8217;ll increase your home&#8217;s resell value for sure.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Carpeted-Floors.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Bathroom Carpet</h2>\n<p>Carpets around the house make at least some sense. But what is the purpose of having a carpeted bathroom floor? Outside of cleaning, when you&#8217;ll need to be on your hands and knees, it really seems to be more of a nuisance, as the carpet is more prone to absorbing water from the shower and sink. And a machine washable bathmat can protect your knees and absorb water while also being more easily to clean and replace.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Carpeted-Bathroom.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Lace Drapes</span></h2>\n<p>Lace drapes look pretty at first, but they&#8217;re prone to wear and tear. The delicate materials tend to fray and yellow over time. Which causes the ultra pretty drapes to become the exact opposite. Fortunately, they&#8217;re easier to replace. Linen is probably the best option for new drapes.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Lace-Drapes.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Flat Panel Doors</span></h2>\n<p>Flat panel doors are mostly inoffensive, but can detract from the overall look and feel in a room. At least in most houses this is the case. A more obvious fix would just be painting the door. They elevate simple-looking hallways and just make your interior more aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Flat-Panel-Door.png'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Corner Tub</span></h2>\n<p>Having a jacuzzi tub in the corner of your bathroom used to be a trendy, cool thing to have. But now those tubs just age your bathroom. If you&#8217;re to still use a tub at all just use a free-standing tub. They don&#8217;t age your bathroom&#8217;s appearance and are generally more budget friendly.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Corner-Tub.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Frameless Doors And Windows</span></h2>\n<p>Frameless doors and windows work in some environments, with frameless windows working particularly well in ultra-modern and glass houses. However, they make your actual house look a little odd. You can get some frames to make these necessary openings in your house more acceptable. There are even some do-it-yourself door and window frame tutorials you can check out to save yourself time and money.</p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Frameless-Window.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Orange Oak Stair Railing</span></h2>\n<p>No one&#8217;s saying you shouldn&#8217;t have a railing on your stairs. Just, maybe it shouldn&#8217;t be this railing. By just replacing this orange oak railing, you&#8217;ll take years off of the age of the apparent age of your house. You might not even have to replace the railing, just paint it a different color. Or even sand down to the natural wood for a more rustic look.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Orange-Oak-Railing.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Boring Bathroom Vanity</span></h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unfamiliar with the term, the vanity is the sink and cabinet in the bathroom commonly below your mirror. And some of these wood-looking ones with simple tile countertops can be a bit boring. You can get a different vanity that&#8217;s much more interesting-looking. And there are plenty that are within your budget that will compliment your bathroom.</p>\n<div class=\"o-Attribution__m-Body\"><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nathroom-Vanity.jpeg'/></figure></div>\n<div><!--nextpage--></div>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Ornate Light Fixtures</span></h2>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t live in a mansion, owning a chandelier will look tacky. It&#8217;s best to just have normal light fixtures, like ceiling fans. There are some more streamlined light fixtures as well. Chandeliers and other ornate light fixtures are also incredibly heavy. While the likelihood of them just falling are pretty low, you&#8217;ll still at least be safer not having to worry about them falling on your head.</p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ornate-Light-Fixtures.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Dome Light Fixtures</span></h2>\n<p>Dome light fixtures have a nickname&#8230; one that won&#8217;t be said here. Their design not only ages the appearance of your house, but they don&#8217;t look that great either. There are plenty of other options for light fixtures, such as semi-flush linen drum lights and glass shade pendant lights.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Boob-Lights.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Grey Color Palettes</h2>\n<p>Gray-on-gray was a really popular design trend in 2015. However, after a few years everyone started to realize that looked pretty tacky. It&#8217;s a good, neutral color for interiors, but there is such a thing as too much grey. Seriously, just a splash of color, or maybe even just some white in the interior of your house can have you living room looking much better.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Grey.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Fuzzy Toilet Seat Cover</span></h2>\n<p>You probably only see these fuzzy toilet seat covers at your grandparents&#8217; house. And that alone should be a sign of how much they can age the appearance of your restroom. Just getting rid of the seat covering will make your bathroom look twenty years younger. You really don&#8217;t need the toilet seat back to be comfortable to sit on.</p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Toilet-Seat-Cover.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Sleigh Beds</span></h2>\n<p>These beds do look a lot like sleighs, don&#8217;t they? They used to be really popular, but now look a bit more out of place with contemporary decor. Getting an updated bed frame is the easiest way to fix this problem. Although, if you want to save money, you can try draping your duvet over the footboard. That&#8217;ll help minimize the recognizable silhouette of the bed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sleigh-Bed.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Glass Block Windows</span></h2>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p>Glass block window designs are really cumbersome and difficult to design around. A standard glass-paned window is more timeless and easier to to make changes in decor around. However, if you can&#8217;t afford to switch out the window, you can install Roman shades instead. They minimize the visibility of the glass blocks.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Glass-Block-Windows.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Heavy Iron Accents</span></h2>\n<p>Railings on staircases can really send a message about the vibe of your house that you&#8217;re going for. And using heavy iron accents can give off the vibe of &#8220;early 2000s contemporary&#8221;. Pull those out and start fresh. A good alternative are minimalist metal balusters. They&#8217;ll be just as sturdy, but not as gaudy.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Heavy-Iron-Accents.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">White Appliances</span></h2>\n<p>White fridges, dishwashers, and other appliances aren&#8217;t quite as good to look at nowadays as they used to be. Stainless steel is a much more timeless and streamlined appearance. They&#8217;re also just easier to keep clean. Alternatively, you can get appliances integrated into your kitchen. They take up less space and look just as aesthetically pleasing.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/White-Appliances.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Chalkboard Walls</span></h2>\n<p>Having a canvas somewhere in your house with which to write notes and leave reminders isn&#8217;t a bad idea. But doing it with a chalkboard might not be the best way to go. Especially if you have it in your kitchen. They&#8217;re just more prone to leaving behind dust and debris. Use adifferent type of message board instead if you&#8217;re going to use anything. Even a dry erase board would be less of a hassle.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chalkboard-Wall.png'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Chevron</span></h2>\n<p>Chevron was a nice wall pattern once. But times change, and Chevron isn&#8217;t exactly timeless. Remove any Chevron wallpaper you have immediately and start looking into other patterns. A particularly popular one presently is herringbone.</p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chevron-1.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Burnt Out Fireplace Design</span></h2>\n<p>A fireplace isn&#8217;t a bad look by itself. But give a second thought about implementing a burnt out-looking one. It&#8217;s a case of &#8220;overkill contemporary&#8221;. Invest some money and time into upgrading the face of your fireplace instead, using a new mantel of custom tile surround. To get it done even faster, you could just try painting around the fireplace with a bold, unexpected hue.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Burnt-out-Fireplace.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Obvious Ceiling Fan</span></h2>\n<p>Sometimes when you walk into the room, the first thing you see is the ceiling fan. They can be useful for cooling off or circulating air in the warmer months, but that doesn&#8217;t meant they have to look tacky. There are plenty of other ceiling fan designs that are a lot more subtle and difficult to notice. And they&#8217;re not any less effective at cooling you off.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ceiling-Fan-Eyesore.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Sterile, Snowy, And Silver</span></h2>\n<p>Sterile, snowy, and silver refers to this color palette right here. And that palette is blindingly white. It&#8217;s described as ultra-modern, but it looks more like a science fiction future. You won&#8217;t necessarily need to eradicate all the white in your home, but putting in some more saturated colors will help your house look a little less strange.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sterile.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2 class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Headline\"><span class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-HeadlineText\">Textured Ceiling</span></h2>\n<p>Textured ceilings, and textured walls for that matter, haven&#8217;t been popular in years. The design choice will probably never come back. The coloration actually gives similar vibes to a prison cell. Seriously, just smooth out your ceiling and walls to a nicer texture. It&#8217;ll be much less difficult to look at after that.</p>\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<div class=\"o-PhotoGalleryPromo__a-Description asset-description\">\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Textured-Ceiling.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n",

Here are a few good examples of the different beauty standards around the world.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Crooked Teeth – Japan</h2>\n<p>In the western part of the world, having a set of straight teeth is considered the norm. At least more appealing. But in other parts of the world, that&#8217;s not exactly the case. In Japan, they actually have dentists do the opposite of helping straightening out your teeth, getting them more crooked instead. This is considered cuter. It also sometimes makes the canines appear more pronounced or seemingly longer, which is another style trend popular in Japan.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Crooked-Teeth.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Extra Weight – Mauritania</h2>\n<p>In a lot of countries in the world, having a slimmer figure is more desirable. It&#8217;s not even an &#8220;east vs. west&#8221; sort of thing. People just want to look skinnier nowadays. And while the idea that you &#8220;need&#8221; a slimmer body is changing, most still want to be slimmed down. But in Mauritania, the opposite is True. They don&#8217;t necessarily have to be overweight, but men in this land prefer women with more meat on their bones. They find them a lot more attractive in comparison to skinnier women.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mauritania.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>High Forehead – Africa</h2>\n<p>Just remember that, no matter what you look like, someone will find your attractive. You may know some people that don&#8217;t like high foreheads, but the Fula Tribe of Africa do. Some of the women in the tribes even remove parts of their hair so that they can create a higher forehead.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/High-Forehead.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Long Necks – Burma</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as uncommon as you might think that certain cultures find the neck to be an attractive part of the body. Although, they may not expect you to do anything to accentuate your neck. In Eastern Burma though, the Kayan Tribe stretches their necks out. Literally. They wear brass ring necklaces to get that effect.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Long-Neck.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Unibrows – Tajikistan</h2>\n<p>Most people in the western world find unibrows to be mock-worthy. Or they&#8217;re at least stared at. Westerners just don&#8217;t find them very attractive. But in Tajikistan, the unibrow is a sign of beauty, for both men and women. Some women that don&#8217;t have unibrows will even pencil one in.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Unibrow.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Stretched Earlobes – Africa</h2>\n<p>Most cultures don&#8217;t have any real issue with ear piercings. Although, earlobe stretching isn&#8217;t quite an across the board sort of thing. The Masai Tribe purposely stretch out their ear lobes over time with heavy jewelry. Both men and women. Although, as far as women go, their longer ear lobes aren&#8217;t just a sign of beauty, but also a status symbol.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Masai-Tribe.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Face Tattoo – New Zealand</h2>\n<p>The Māori Tribe, native to New Zealand, are well-known for their love of tattoos. In certain western cultures, facial tattoos may be considered eye-catching, but not necessarily attractive. Sometimes they even prevent you from getting jobs. But not in New Zealand. Māori women often get facial tattoos to show which tribe they specifically come from and their standing within them. So they&#8217;re not just considered attractive, but have functions in their culture as well.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Face-Tattoo.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Body Hair – France</h2>\n<p>Fun fact, body hair was once used by people in prehistoric times to attract mates. That&#8217;s not so much the case nowadays, and in a lot of cultures people consider body hair to be unattractive. Or at least not particularly alluring. But that isn&#8217;t the case in France.Some French people actually prefer their partners to have more hair on their body. It might not be as popular a trend as it used to be, but people in France don&#8217;t need to worry as much about shaving.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Body-Hair.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Double Eyelids – South Korea</h2>\n<p>Double eyelids, which are when they have a crease on them, are actually a dominant trait. So only one parent needs to have them to pass them on. But in a lot of East Asian countries, people are more likely to have monolids. Those are eyelids without the crease. This led to a trend in South Korea wherein people start to get cosmetic surgery to get double eyelids. They&#8217;re actually just considered more attractive in that country.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Double-Eyelid.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Extraocular Implant – Netherlands</h2>\n<p>Eyes are the windows to the soul. Some people enjoy looking into the eyes of their significant other and it&#8217;ll often be a sign of affection. And that&#8217;s believed to have led to the emergence of extraocular implants in the Netherlands. It&#8217;s a small, surgical procedure that involves implanting a piece of molded platinum into a person&#8217;s eye. While the actually process sounds daunting, the results are interesting. And clearly the Dutch find the implants to be attractive in the first place, or else they wouldn&#8217;t keep doing them.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Extraocular-Implant.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Sharp Teeth – Indonesia</h2>\n<p>This is another example of how the attractiveness of your smile is dependent on your culture. In the west, they like straight teeth. In Japan, they like them crooked. And Indonesia, they like them spiky. Some tribes in that country file their teeth into sharp points. And they&#8217;re considered a mark of beauty. It is quite a painful experience, but well worth it in their society.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sharp-Teeth.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Bigger Noses – Afghanistan</h2>\n<p>Many western countries think that smaller and straight noses are more attractive. Of course, that isn&#8217;t a universal idea. For example, in Afghanistan, larger and more hooked noses are considered attractive. Some Afghani women actually get rhinoplasty surgery to get their noses enlarged.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Big-Nose.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Guitar Shape – Brazil</h2>\n<p>The ideal body image of women differs from country to country. Although, the most commonly known one is the hourglass. But some people think that this figure makes someone look malnourished. The guitar shape however, which is a popular body type in Brazil, promotes a stronger and fuller physique. It allows for women to have wider hips but a smaller chest.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Guitar-Body.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Mustaches – The Middle East</h2>\n</div>\n<p>A lot of these beauty trends have applied primarily to women or both sexes, but this one only applies to men. Not everyone in the West likes facial hair, but people in the Middle East love mustaches. Men consider them to be symbols of masculinity, prestige, virility, and wisdom. Some men even get mustache hair transplants to give them thicker mustaches.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mustache.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Nose Rings – South Asia</h2>\n<p>Intricate nose piercings like this are often associated with India. But they&#8217;re equally as popular in other South Asian countries like Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Ordinarily, the piercing is done on a woman on the left side of the nose. They&#8217;re considered a social status symbol, but are also associated with the Hindu goddess of marriage, Parvati. It is common for Indian women to wear elaborate nose jewelry on their wedding day.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nose-Rings.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Extremely Long Hair – India</h2>\n<p>Long hair is popular in a lot of different parts of the world. It&#8217;s commonly associated with femininity, fertility, and sensuality. But, in India, they like to grow out their hair incredibly long. Akanksha Yadav even broke records with her hair being ten feet long. Some hair is grown out and donated to a temple as a spiritual offering. Men get in on the long hair practice too. Although it&#8217;s Sikh men who practice <em>kesh</em>, a practice wherein they simply do not cut their hair. They believe its a creation of God and should not be changed.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Extremely-Long-Hair.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Cosmetic Contact Lenses – East Asia</h2>\n<p>Darker-colored eye colors are incredibly common in East Asian countries. But, some people want their eyes to stand out a bit more. That&#8217;s what led to the rise of cosmetic contact lenses. They&#8217;re colored, non-prescription lenses. They come in many shades and designs. While most only give the eye a larger and more rounded appearance, in addition to a potential color change, some lenses aren&#8217;t even a natural eye color.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cosmetic-Contact-Lenses.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Extremely Long Eyelashes – United States</h2>\n<p>Eyelashes are designed to keep dust and debris out of the eye. But their length and style can also change the appearance of someone&#8217;s eyes. The longer they are, they can make eyes look larger and more feminine. In the United States specifically, women have taken to using False eyelashes to give them fuller and longer lashes. And others even go as far as to get lash growth serums and extensions.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Long-Eyelashes.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Big Belly – Ethiopia</h2>\n<p>This is another beauty trend used by men instead of women. This one in Ethopia is a bit unexpected. As it turns out, larger bellies are seen as incredibly attractive. Men will commonly eat more to achieve this look. Ethiopian people even have traditions put in place to help men achieve this desired physique.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Big-Belly.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Rosy Cheeks – Arctic</h2>\n<p>Yes, there are, in fact, inhabitants in the Arctic Circle. This is where the Chukchi people live. And they, too, have their own standards of beauty. People in these tribes have rosy cheeks from the colder temperatures. Children with these cheeks are considered cute. But adults with these cheeks are found to be quite beautiful.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rosy-Cheeks.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Nose Jobs – Iran</h2>\n<p>Nose jobs are so popular in Iran that it&#8217;s not uncommon to see someone walking around with bandages on their nose. The straight nose in particular is the look many want to get, even if the procedure is a bit expensive. Many people, both men and women, get nose jobs to get the look they want.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nose-Jobs.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Glass Skin – South Korea</h2>\n</div>\n<p>Many cultures like the idea of natural beauty, but are still equally as likely to focus on makeup. But in South Korea, they try to make their skin so flawless that it actually appears shiny and borderline translucent. It&#8217;s known as glass skin and has become the standard for beauty for many in this country. Supposedly, you can get your skin like this using a ten-step regimen, but it sounds like a lot of work.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Glass-Skin.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Chest Augmentation – Venezuela</h2>\n<p>Venezuela isn&#8217;t the only country where a larger bust is considered desirable. But the obsession of it in the country has led to a massive boom in plastic surgery procedures. It&#8217;s basically a regular part of life, and it lacks the same stigmas against it that are in other countries. The pressure to look a certain way even leads to women getting plastic surgery at as young as 15.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chest-Augmentation.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Body Scarification – West Africa</h2>\n<p>Scars definitely aren&#8217;t something that people find universally attractive. Some people might find them cool, but not much more than that. Some tribes in West Africa uses scars as a sign of beauty. Although, the amount of beauty these small, scarification marks being beautiful is only attached to women. The scars for men are a sign of strength.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Body-Scarification.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<div class=\"page-title\">\n<h2>Cheek Piercing – Thailand</h2>\n<p>Dimple piercings are about as far as people are willing to go in the Western. But in Thailand, you&#8217;ll find they even do cheek piercings. They&#8217;re looked upon as a sign of beauty, as well as one of religious devotion. Both men and women get cheek piercings, with the size of the hole varying from person to person.</p>\n</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cheek-Piercing.webp'/></figure></p>\n",

"rendered": "<p>Americans seem to have been getting a pretty bad reputation for seeming signs of entitlement and general rudeness. Well, that reputation isn&#8217;t entirely unearned. But at the same time, not every part of America has the same culture in regard to social interaction. As a matter of fact, several states are a lot more rude than others. The magazine <em>Best Life</em> did a ranking of the rudest states by population and these were the results.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>50. Minnesota</h2>\n<p>To many people, it probably isn&#8217;t surprising that Minnesota is ranked at the bottom of this list. It&#8217;s just not in Minnesotan nature to be rude. <em>Best Life </em>had them at the bottom of state rankings for general unfriendliness, as well as 48th for rude customers. The percentage of that state that was considered rude wasn&#8217;t even over one percent. The overall &#8220;Rudeness Score&#8221; given was a big, fat zero. Although, it was determined that the rudest city was Minneapolis-St. Paul.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Minnesota.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>49. South Carolina</h2>\n<p>South Carolina is a lot more rude than Minnesota. But that&#8217;s not exactly saying they&#8217;re that rude. South Carolinians are pretty polite overall. Their unfriendly and rude customer rank were 48th and 47th respectively. And their percentage of rude drivers was only 2.1. The overall rudeness score <em>Best Life </em>gave them was 2.31.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/South-Carolina.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>48. Louisiana</h2>\n<p><em>Best Life </em>had another small jump in the rankings, this time between South Carolina to Louisiana. It ranked 39th in terms of generally, unfriendly citizens. But it also ranked 49th for rude customers. It was determined that the rudest city in Louisiana was (and this may not surprise many people) New Orleans. Its overall rudeness score was 7.02.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Orleans.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>47. Mississippi</h2>\n<p>Mississippi&#8217;s another one of the friendlier states, but there&#8217;s been another small jump in the level of unfriendliness. They have a general unfriendly ranking of 28, but their number of rude customers are ranked 47th. The percentage of the population that are notably rude drivers are only 1.3 percent as well. <em>Best Life </em>determined that their overall rudeness score was 10.04.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mississippi.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>46. Tennessee</h2>\n<p>The percentage of the state of Tennessee considered rude by <em>Best Life</em> was only 0.5 percent. Their general unfriendliness rank was 49th, with a rude customer ranking of 30th. Their percentage of rude drivers was also only 2.1. And the percentage of the state as a whole considered rude was only 0.5 percent. It was determined that the rudest cities in Tennessee were Nashville and Memphis. Considering their popularity and size, that seems to match up.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tennessee.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>45. Hawaii</h2>\n<p>Hawaii&#8217;s a state for vacationing and relaxing. It doesn&#8217;t even have a rudest city. But that doesn&#8217;t mean there aren&#8217;t rude people that live there. Its percentage of rude drivers according to <em>Best Life</em> was 3.9 percent. And it was ranked 41st for general unfriendliness. It did rank at the bottom of rude customers though. Its overall rudeness score was 17.07.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hawaii.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>44. Colorado</h2>\n<p>Colorado had pretty low rankings for both its unfriendliness and and rude customers, ranking at 44th and 42nd respectively. The percentage of rude drivers in the state was 3.6, with a percentage of the amount of state considered rude being 0.22 percent. <em>Best Life </em>determined their overall rudeness score to be 19.  The rudest city in Colorado was also believed to be Denver.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Colorado.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>43. Vermont</h2>\n<p>Vermont&#8217;s well-known for its generally peaceful vibe. They may not be at the bottom of the list, but 43rd overall isn&#8217;t that bad. Their rude customer ranking was 45th, but they had a surprisingly high unfriendly rank at 17th. Albeit, their percentage of rude drivers was only 1.5 percent. <em>Best Life </em>determined their overall rudeness score to be 20.59.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vermont.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>42. Texas</h2>\n<p>You&#8217;d probably expect a state the size of Texas to be a bit more rude. But overall, things are pretty relaxed. Albeit, it has four cities that are considered equally rude, that being Dallas, Austin, Houston, and San Antonio. It has a moderate ranking for rude customers at 24th, but its general unfriendliness ranking was 47th. The percentage of the state considered rude, as well as the percentage of rude drivers, was 1.1 percent and 2.1 percent respectively. <em>Best Life </em>gave Texas an overall rudeness score of 21.1.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Texas.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>41. Kentucky</h2>\n<p>Kentucky&#8217;s rudest city is Louisville. It has a percentage of rude drivers of only one percent. And the percentage of rude people in the state is only 0.32 percent. Its rankings for general unfriendliness and rude customers are somewhat middling, at 32nd and 25th respectively. <em>Best Life </em>gave it a rudeness score of 21.35.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kentucky.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>40. Alabama</h2>\n<p>The percentage of Alabama that&#8217;s rude seems to be mostly concentrated in Birmingham, which is considered its rudest city. The percentage of the state that is rude is only 0.4 percent as well, with the percentage of rude drivers being 2.1 percent. Its other rankings were more middling as well, ranking 30th in unfriendliness and 36th in rude customers. The rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>was 22.96.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alabama.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>39. North Carolina</h2>\n<p>North Carolina actually had a rather high unfriendliness ranking at 18th, but its rude customer ranking was rather low at 40th. The percentage of the state was considered rude was 0.35 percent, with 1.6 percent of the state&#8217;s population being considered rude drivers. Much of that was probably split up in its two rudest cities, Charlotte and Raleigh. <em>Best Life </em>gave it a rudeness score of 24.93.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/North-Carolina.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>38. Oklahoma</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a little funny that the city in Oklahoma considered the rudest is called Oklahoma City. Although, the state as a whole isn&#8217;t considered incredibly rude. Their unfriendly rank was 42nd, but their rude customer rank was 26th. The percentage of the state considered rude was 0.38 percent. And the percentage of the population considered rude drivers is 2.6 percent. The overall rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>was 25.02.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Oklahoma-City.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>37. Missouri</h2>\n<p>Missouri has a couple of cities notable for their rudeness, that being St. Louis and Kansas City.  The state as a whole&#8217;s percentage of people considered rude is 0.35 percent, with rude drivers percentage of 2.6 percent. The ranking for general unfriendliness was 29th and the ranking for rude customers was 37th. This led to <em>B</em><em>est Life </em>giving an overall rudeness score of 26.35.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Missouri.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>36. Maine</h2>\n<p>Maine&#8217;s not a very populated state, which means that the amount of rude people living there have more weight to their ranking. Their percentage of rude drivers is around 1.6 percent. But they have a somewhat high rank for unfriendliness at 20th. Their rude customer rank is more middling though, at 33rd. This led to an overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>at 27.62.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Maine.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>35. Nebraska</h2>\n<p>Nebraska&#8217;s unfriendly and rude customer ranking are both somewhat middling. They&#8217;re 38th and 34th respectively. Although their percentage of rude drivers, relative to the state&#8217;s population, is a bit high, at 3.6 percent. The overall rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>was 28.33.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nebraska.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>34. Kansas</h2>\n<p>What&#8217;s funny about Kansas is that the rudest Kansas City is in Missouri. Albeit, Kansas, itself, is still a ruder state. Its percentage of rude drivers is 3.6 percent, its unfriendly rank is 43rd, and its rude customer rank is 27th. This leads to an overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>of 29.73.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kansas.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>33. Indiana</h2>\n<p>Yes, the rudest city in Indiana is Indianapolis. The percentage of the state considered rude is 0.41 percent. The state&#8217;s percentage of rude drivers is also 2.1. They have a pretty low unfriendliness ranking of 45th, but that gets counterbalanced by their pretty high rude customer rank, being 11th. Indiana&#8217;s rudeness score, given by <em>Best Life</em>, ended up as 29.99.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Indiana.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>32. Oregon</h2>\n<p>Considering all the exposure it gets, it might not be that surprising to find out that Portland is the rudest city in Oregon. Only 0.41 percent of the population is considered rude, compared to 3.6% of which are considered rude drivers. They have generally middling ranks for unfriendliness at 27th and rude customers at 38th. But there was a pretty big increase in the overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life</em>. It jumped up to 34.22.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Portland.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>31. New Hampshire</h2>\n<p>New Hampshire is a surprisingly unfriendly state. Its ranking of all states is seventh. However, its rude customer rank is 44th, which makes it seem as though they really just try to keep to themselves. Although, 2.6 percent of New Hampshire&#8217;s population are considered rude drivers. Its rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>was 36.06.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Hampshire.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>30. Pennsylvania</h2>\n<p>The two rudest cities in Pennsylvania are its most famous ones: Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. And given what people know about them, that&#8217;s not that surprising. The percentage of the state considered rude is 1.31 percent. And the percentage of the drivers considered rude are 2.6%. It does have more middling ranking for unfriendliness and rude customers though, at 33rd and 22nd respectively. Its rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>was 36.36.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pennsylvania.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>29. Arkansas</h2>\n<p>Arkansas is the second unfriendliest state in America. That alone would probably tanked Arkansas&#8217; ranking, but it fortunately has a low ranking of rude customers at 43rd. The percentage of rude drivers in the state is 2.1 percent as well. Its overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>is 36.77.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Arkansas.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>28. Georgia</h2>\n<p>It might not be that surprising that the rudest city in Georgia is Atlanta. Although, the percentage of the state that is rude is 0.44 percent. Although its percentage of rude drivers is higher than most at 4.4 percent of the population. It does have rather low rankings for for unfriendliness and rude customers though, at 35th and 32nd respectively. <em>Best Life </em>gave Georgia a rudeness score of 38.51.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Georgia.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>27. Florida</h2>\n<p>Miami, Jacksonville, Tampa, and Orlando are considered some of the rudest cities in the heavily populated state. Additionally, Florida is considered the ninth unfriendliest state. This is somewhat countered by the rude customer rank of 39th, which is pretty low. The percentage of the state that&#8217;s considered rude is 0.52 percent and the percentage of rude drivers is 2.6 percent. This leads to a <em>Best Life </em>rudeness score of 39.41.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Florida.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>26. New Mexico</h2>\n<p>New Mexico is a somewhat sparsely occupied state. But they also rank second in terms of rude customers. Their ranking with unfriendliness isn&#8217;t as bad, but even then it&#8217;s still a more middling 34. Their percentage of rude drivers is also 1.6 percent. <em>Best Life </em>gave New Mexico a rudeness score of 39.58.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Mexico.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>25. Nevada</h2>\n<p>Yes, the rudest city in Nevada is Las Vegas. The state as a whole seems a little bit belligerent. Their unfriendliness rank was eighth. Their rude customer rank was 31st. Their percentage of rude people in the state and their percentage of rude drivers is almost one-to-one, at 1.68 percent to 1.6 percent. Their rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>is 41.46.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nevada.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>24. West Virginia</h2>\n<p>West Virginia&#8217;s unfriendliness and rude customer rankings are pretty high. They&#8217;re at 21st and 12th respectively. The percentage of rude drivers in the state isn&#8217;t too good either, with it being 1.6. Their <em>Best Life </em>rudeness score is only a little bit higher Nevada&#8217;s at 41.69 too. And unlike Nevada, it doesn&#8217;t have any big tourist locations.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/West-Virginia.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>23. Maryland</h2>\n<p>If you were to guess which city in Maryland was the rudest, your first instinct may have been to say Baltimore. And you&#8217;d be correct. Maryland also ranks pretty poorly in regard to unfriendliness and rude customers. It ranked 24th in unfriendliness and 16th in rude customers. 1.1 percent of the state is also known to be rude, in addition to 2.1 percent of the drivers being considered rude. The rudeness score for Maryland given by <em>Best Life </em>was 42.9.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Baltimore.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>22. Connecticut</h2>\n<p>Only 0.11 percent of Connecticut is actually considered rude. And seemingly that&#8217;s mostly in Hartford. 2.1 percent of their drivers are also considered rude. Their unfriendliness rank is pretty bad as well, being 13th. And their rude customer rank is still in the upper half at 23d. Their rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>is 43.35.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Connecticut.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>21. Arizona</h2>\n<p>When you think of Arizona, Phoenix is probably the first city you think up.

Of its unfriendliness ranking, Arizona is 12th. Its rude customer ranking is slightly below the half line at 29th. The state&#8217;s overall rudeness score, given by <em>Best Life</em>, was 44.1.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Arizona.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>20. South Dakota</h2>\n<p>South Dakota has a moderate unfriendly ranking, at 31. But the customers are far more rude with a ranking of 13. The percentage of drivers in the state that are also rude is 3.1 percent. You wouldn&#8217;t expect a state so unpopulated to be this rude exactly, cracking the top 20 of the states in the United States. Its <em>Best Life </em>rudeness score was 44.5.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/South-Dakota.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>19. Ohio</h2>\n<p>Cleveland, Cincinnati, and Columbus are the rudest cities in Ohio. The state has a pretty low population or rude people at 0.46 percent. But 4.3 percent of their drivers are considered rude. They also rank pretty low in the unfriendliness category, at 40th. But their rude customer ranking is a bit higher at 17th. Their overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>was 44.9.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ohio.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>18. Illinois</h2>\n<p>Illinois actually has a rare distinction in that, at least by percent, more of its population (which is 3.94 percent) is considered rude as opposed to its number of rude drivers (which is 3.1 percent). Its unfriendliness rank is 37th, while its rude customer rank is much higher at 18th. The rudest city is also Chicago.

It has a really low unfriendliness ranking at 46th, but it&#8217;s still the 10th rudest state in regard to rude customers. The overall <em>Best Life </em>rudeness score given was 48.02.</p>\n<h2 data-slot=\"div-gpt-lazy-square-fixed-tier4\"><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wyoming.jpeg'/></figure></h2>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>15. Montana</h2>\n<p>Montana doesn&#8217;t have a city notable for its rudeness, but it has pretty bad rankings for unfriendliness and rude customers. Its ranked 15th and 19th in both categories respectively. And 2.6 percent of the drivers in the state are considered rude. This led to <em>Best Life </em>giving Montana an overall rudeness score of 48.02.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Montana.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>14. New Jersey</h2>\n<p>Some people probably would have expected New Jersey to top this lest. Well that isn&#8217;t for a lack of trying. On the unfriendliness ranking, it was fifth. Although, its rude customer ranking was a bit more middling, at 35th. 3.6 percent of the drivers in the state were also considered rude. The rudeness score for New Jersey given by <em>Best Life </em>was 50.83.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-jersey.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<div data-slot=\"div-gpt-lazy-square-fixed-tier4\"><!--nextpage--></div>\n<h2 data-slot=\"div-gpt-lazy-square-fixed-tier4\">13. North Dakota</h2>\n<p>North Dakota is the ruder of the two Dakotas. Its unfriendliness ranking was just in the bottom half of all states at 26th. But its rude customer ranking was much higher at seventh. Its percentage of drivers considered rude was also pretty high at 3.1 percent. This caused <em>Best Life </em>to give it a rudeness score of 52.24.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/North-Dakota.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>12. Delaware</h2>\n<p>Delaware&#8217;s ranking are on opposite ends of the spectrum here. Its rude customer ranking is 41st but its unfriendliness ranking is third. The percentage of rude drivers is rather high as well at 4.2 percent, helping to put it this high up on the rankings. <em>Best Life </em>gave it a rudeness score of 52.24 because of these factors.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Delaware.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>11. Wisconsin</h2>\n<p>The percentage of Wisconsin citizens considered rude is actually pretty low, at 0.15 percent. But it still has pretty bad rankings in the other categories. 3.8 percent of the drivers in the state are considered rude. Its rude customer ranking is also ninth. And its unfriendliness ranking, which is its best one, is 25th. The rudest city in Wisconsin is considered Milwaukee. Its overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>was 56.82.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wisconsin.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>10. Idaho</h2>\n<p>Idaho has a really high percentage of rude drivers at 4.9 percent. But its rude customer ranking is also eighth. This gets offset somewhat but its unfriendliness ranking, which is 36th, but it&#8217;s still rude enough to have it just crack the top ten. The rudeness score given to Idaho by <em>Best Life </em>is 57.16.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Idaho.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>9. California</h2>\n<p>Considering the size of California and its reputation, is it really surprising that it ranks ninth on this list overall. It also has the most cities considered the &#8220;rudest&#8221;. They are Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Diego, San Jose, and Riverside. 2.47 percent of the state is considered rude, as well as 3.1 percent of the drivers. Its unfriendliness rank is 11th and its rude customer ranking is 21st. Its rudeness score given by <em>Best Life </em>was 58.82.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/California.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>8. Rhode Island</h2>\n<p>Providence, Rhode Island: the rudest city in the state. Not a high percentage of the state is considered rude, at 0.26 percent, but its rude enough in plenty of other ways to get eighth place on this list. 3.1 percent of its drivers are considered rude, its unfriendliness rank is tenth, and its rude customer rank is 14th. <em>Best Life</em> gave Rhode Island a rudeness score of 59.17.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Rhode-Island.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>7. Massachusetts</h2>\n<p>Massachusetts&#8217; cities are known for the belligerent nature of their citizens. Especially in Boston, the rudest city of the state. Although, that doesn&#8217;t mean everyone&#8217;s rude, as only 1.5 percent of the state is considered so. Additionally, 3.1 percent of the drivers are considered rude. Its unfriendliness rank is pretty bad though at fourth place, with a rude customer rank of 20th. This led to a pretty notable jump in the rudeness score from <em>Best Life</em>, at 62.13.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Massachusetts.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>6. Utah</h2>\n<p>Only 0.1 percent of Utah&#8217;s population is considered generally rude. But they really make up for it in other areas. Their percentage of rude drivers is 3.6 percent. Their unfriendliness ranking is 19th. And their rude customer ranking is fifth. The rudest city in the state is also Salt Lake City. Their <em>Best Life </em>rudeness score is 62.32.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Utah.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>5. Alaska</h2>\n<p>With the small population and nature of Alaska, it&#8217;s actually somewhat surprising that they&#8217;re this high on the list. But a small population probably means that the rudeness of each citizen is more notable. The percentage of drivers that are rude in the state is 3.1. And it also has an unfriendliness rank of 14. Alaska is also the third rudest state in America when it comes to customers. <em>Best Life </em>gave Alaska a rudeness score of 63.49.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Alaska.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>4. Iowa</h2>\n<p>Iowa has one of the higher percentage of rude drivers in the state at 4.1. Its overall unfriendliness rank is also 22nd place, a few notches above the middle spot. Although their most notable point is their fourth place spot for rude customers. Their overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>was 64.19.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Iowa.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>3. Washington</h2>\n<p>Washington&#8217;s rudeness score had another jump at this in its rudeness score. And here&#8217;s why. While only 0.31 percent of the state is considered rude, with 3.1 percent of its drivers having the same treatment, it has abysmal rankings in unfriendliness and rude customers. Both rankings for Washington were sixth, with its rudest city being Seattle. The overall rudeness score from <em>Best Life </em>was 67.74.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Seattle.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>2. Virginia</h2>\n<p>The number two spot, unsurprisingly, has some of worst statistics for a rude state. Although it may be a bit surprising that Virginia&#8217;s number two to begin with (unless you live there). Its rudest cities were Virginia Beach and Richmond. Only 0.14 percent of the state is considered rude, which is pretty low, but its got other stats to make up for that. It has the highest percentage of rude drivers on the list at five percent. Its unfriendliness ranking was 16th and its rude customer ranking was first. This led to <em>Best Life</em> giving Virginia and rudeness score of 77.19.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='http://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Virginia-750x422.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>1. New York</h2>\n<p>The fact that New York is the number one rudest state in America may come as a surprise to no one, its rudest cities being New York City and Buffalo. The percentage of the state considered rude was a whomping 14.79 percent. Its percentage of rude drivers was 4.5 percent, which isn&#8217;t beaten by a lot of states. Its rude customer ranking was 28th, but its unfriendliness ranking was first. This all led to <em>Best Life </em>to give it an unprecedented 100.05 for its rudeness score.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-York-City.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n",

},
"content": {
"rendered": "<p class=\"entry-title\"> Pareidolia is the tendency to find meaning, faces, or patterns in everyday things. The most commonly seen way this happens is with the appearance of smiley faces. Of course, those smiley faces aren&#8217;t actually faces and just happen to be shaped in a certain way. But they can still be pretty amusing. Here are some of the most amusing examples of pareidolia experiences.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2> A Surprised Building</h2>\n<p>When you got shocked you always make a sort of &#8220;O&#8221; face. It&#8217;s curious to imagine what this building saw that made its face permanently look like this. It&#8217;s an old house so it&#8217;s certainly had the chance to see quite a few things. Like that fruit tree in the foreground having been planted. Or maybe it was just surprised by the fact that it realized its eyes were the heads of two statues.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Surprised-Building.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Smile Of Birds</h2>\n<p>They&#8217;re only a small flock, but they left quite the impression. Flying off into the sunset, they&#8217;re probably as happy to be together as the smiling face their formation made appears to be. Or maybe they actually just hate each other. After all, three&#8217;s a crowd.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Birds-in-the-Sky.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Coffee Frog</h2>\n<p>Ribbit! Looks like a frog hopped into your coffee. Don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;ll probably be gone in a few more sips. And frogs certainly aren&#8217;t the most dangerous animal you could put in your mouth. You&#8217;ll be fine. Unless that&#8217;s a cane toad. Never put a cane toad in your mouth.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Coffee-Frog.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Face Of Chocolate Milk</h2>\n<p>When you drop gallon containers of milk they pretty likely to crumple like this. That is, if they don&#8217;t break. But this one looks a little but like an Easter Island head! Certainly an interesting face on their part. Just make sure to be careful with you milk and chocolate milk. Or else you might find yourself seeing faces in them forever.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chocolate-Milk.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Stalk-Eyed Stroller</h2>\n<p>It almost looks like a shocked alien from one of those CG animated movies. It looks like it wants to get up and start crawling around your house. But hey, that&#8217;s strollers for you. You don&#8217;t allows think about what the back of them look like anyway. Especially when folded up.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Stroller.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>One Angry Mop</h2>\n<p>Those squinting eyes. That small mouth. This mop looks irrationally angry. And the yarn of the mop looks like they just have a series of blonde dreads. Maybe it&#8217;s angry about how bad its haircut is. Or maybe it&#8217;s just angry that it&#8217;s being used as a mop.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angry-Mop.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Smoking A Magazine</h2>\n<p>When you roll up magazines or other papers like this it really gives a certain impression when you place in the mouth of this mailbox. Or at least any other mailbox that looks like a blank face. He looks a little out of it too.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mailbox.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Orange You Ready To Dance?</h2>\n<p>This orange is truly ready to dance. They&#8217;ve got their hands up and look ready to sway those hips. Let&#8217;s just put on some music for them. What kind of dance to they do? They seem like they&#8217;re great at it.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Orange.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Some Surprising Baggage</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s a hard face to explain. You know what that face is and what it represents, but you can&#8217;t put it into words. But, at the same time you still think it looks hilarious. They certainly look surprised.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Baggage.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Monster Pepper</h2>\n<p>At the bare minimum, someone didn&#8217;t get all the seeds out of this pepper. It looks like its got a gnarly maw of teeth. And it really doesn&#8217;t seem like a particularly kind host. It looks like it might try to take a bite out of you instead.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Monster-Pepper.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Mr. Potato Face</h2>\n<p>Poor potato looks so sad. Maybe if it got a quick wash before getting boiled it&#8217;d feel a little better. Something&#8217;s gotta help him feel better. Otherwise he just continues to look a little haunting. A bit more on the disturbing side.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/POtato.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>This Onion Will Make You Cry</h2>\n<p>This onion&#8217;s smarmy face as you start to cut it. It knows what it&#8217;s doing, and it doesn&#8217;t care. It&#8217;s going to enjoy making you cry. And it&#8217;s not like you can stop until you&#8217;ve finished.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Onion.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Sad Bananas</h2>\n<p>Those brown spots inside of bananas always seem to make faces. But normally they don&#8217;t seem so sad. They probably didn&#8217;t want to get cut up in the first place. Maybe they&#8217;ll look happier if you turn them upside down.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sad-Bananas.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Content To Be Eaten</h2>\n<p>Eye closed with a smile on its face. This loaf of lemon raspberry bread has made peace with its situation. And it seems to actually be looking forward to it.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Content-Bread.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Robot Glasses Holder</h2>\n<p>This one&#8217;s not so much a human face. More like a robot face. And it looks very happy to eat your sunglasses now that you&#8217;re in the car. This &#8220;Iron Giant&#8221; must certainly be hungry.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Robot.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Hello Recycling Bin</h2>\n<p>Sometimes when you can&#8217;t fit your boxes in your recycling bins you end up with these little gems. It looks a little happy actually, like it wanted to greet you. The flap on its left side even looks like it&#8217;s waving at you.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Recycle-Me.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Man In The Clouds</h2>\n<p>This cloud formation would probably look completely different if you were looking at it straight on. Fortunately, we&#8217;re looking at its profile. And it looks like Zeus, himself, has manifested before us!</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cloudy.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Worn Out And Fed Up</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s just a fact that the more you sit in chairs the more worn out they&#8217;ll get. And this one just looks tired of all the sitting. And a little miffed too. Next time you need a chair, don&#8217;t pick this one. They clearly won&#8217;t like it.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Worn-Out-Chair.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Dog In the Wood Grain</h2>\n<p>It seriously just looks like a chihuahua or beagle, or some other small dog like that. Just etched into the wood. It&#8217;s actually a little cute. You might even want to take this dog home with you. Until you realize that it can&#8217;t ever leave that spot.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dog.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Baby-Faced Apple</h2>\n<p>The shape and structure of the apple does make it look like a baby face (or maybe a Cabbage Patch Kid). But the colorization of the &#8220;mouth&#8221; and &#8220;eyes&#8221; makes this look like a bit more of a demon than normal. The apple might have rotted a little.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Apple.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Skull In The Parfait</h2>\n<p>Everybody loves parfait! At least until a dark omen like this appears in your desert. You might be having nightmares about this bloody skull after a little while. You might not like parfait anymore after this encounter.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Parfait.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Bent Pinocchio</h2>\n<p>Do you think Pinocchio&#8217;s life would&#8217;ve been a bit easier if his nose bent upwards after it grew out a certain length. Hopefully not, that puppet needed to learn a lesson regardless of how his nose grew. But this one still gave way to a funny image.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bent-Pinnochio.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Light Switch Side Eye</h2>\n<p>You must have done something really questionable for the light switches to looking at you like this. Their faces and head structure actually looks like they could be a Muppet.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Side-Eye.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Gnocchi Monster</h2>\n<p>Speaking of Muppets, what a coincidence! Putting in some pasta to get boiled. And then the bubbles help form this shape. Technically he&#8217;s not the Cookie Monster though. More like the Gnocchi Monster.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cookie-Monster.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Cat In The Bag</h2>\n<p>Well, technically not in the bag. More like he is the bag. Plastic bags are so light and malleable, it&#8217;s pretty easy to get them stand up. But they don&#8217;t look like animals all that often.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cat-in-the-Bag.webp'/></figure></p>\n",

},
"content": {
"rendered": "<p>Everyone knows what submarines are and have at least a basic understanding of how they work. However, not a lot of people know what it&#8217;s exactly like living in a submarine. While it&#8217;d be hard to exactly paint a full picture of the experience, here are at least a few aspects of what the submarine life is like.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Submarine Training</h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that becoming a submariner is not easy. There&#8217;s a ton of training that goes into it. The first few months of it are spent studying non-stop and marching back and forth. It&#8217;s essentially cramming four to six years of college-level information into a six-month period.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Training.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Watch Hours</h2>\n<p>Before 2014, the submarine force had 18-hour days wherein sailors would watch for six hours and had 12 hours off for other duties and sleeping. This was eventually changed to eight and 16 hours respectively. The effect was noted to be immediately positive, with morale and performance having improved considerably.</p>\n<div class=\"page-finished\"><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Watchkeeping.jpeg'/></figure></div>\n<div><!--nextpage--></div>\n<h2>Never Steal On A Submarine</h2>\n<p>Stealing is always frowned upon (and illegal), but it&#8217;s even worse when you steal on a submarine. Stealing on a submarine will get you kicked off at the next port. This can also lead to demotions. Submarine crews are all on the same side and in an enclosed space. You&#8217;ll get found out eventually and lose the trust of your companions.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Theft.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Sharing A Bed</h2>\n<p>Submarines are cramped and small. So, there&#8217;s not enough room for bunks for each person in crew. This leads to two or three people sharing the same bunk with each other. They just work in shifts so that they&#8217;re not all sleeping at the same time. The term for it is &#8220;hot racking&#8221;.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-insides.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Anytime, Anywhere</h2>\n<p>People that live and work on a submarine often develop a strange talent. That being that they can fall asleep at any time in any place. They can even be in the middle of a conversation and just pass out. But if you call for them at a lower tone, they&#8217;ll instantly wake back up.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sleeping-on-a-Submarine.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Sleeping With Torpedoes</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s already not enough bunk space for everyone, so sometimes the sailors really have to make do. And Sometimes, temporary bunks are placed in the torpedo room. While they&#8217;re unlikely to go off while asleep, it&#8217;s still an unsettling location to need to sleep in.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Torpedo-Bunk.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Sleeping Next To Nukes</h2>\n<p>Sleeping on a submarine can get quickly concerning. Because you&#8217;ll realize you&#8217;re constantly resting next to dangerous weapons. Torpedoes, missiles, and even nuclear warheads. Some submarines have nuclear reactors as well, making the experience all the more dangerous.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Reactor.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Under The Sea</h2>\n<p>It can be very easy to lose track of time while working on a submarine. This shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising, as there&#8217;s never any sunlight entering the sub. This is because it operates primarily underwater. And the reliance on radar also means there are few, if any, windows. You will have access to a clock, but it&#8217;s the only way to really know how much time is going by.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Underwater.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Lower Oxygen</h2>\n<p>Submarines keep their oxygen levels at an absolute minimum. They don&#8217;t want to worry about pressure or explosions, but the lack of oxygen does have some negative side effects. One such being a decreased ability to recover when injured. Lower oxygen levels also will lower your energy and contribute to mood swings. So being on one probably isn&#8217;t a particularly positive experience.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Oxygen-Tanks.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Mundane Life</h2>\n<p>Although you may think things are constantly tense, once you get used to certain experiences, life on a submarine is rather mundane. Crews follow the same schedule every day. But if things were more exciting, that would mean that something went wrong.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mundane-Life.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Hearing From Your Loved Ones</h2>\n<p>Considering the amount of time you spend underwater, cut off from civilization, it should come as no surprise that you won&#8217;t get to communicate with your family members for some time. The submarine emits a signal that shows its location when it surfaces, and that&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d want to have happen while on a dangerous mission.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Radio-Room.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Grooming Habits</h2>\n<p>Most military branches are adamant about having clean-cut soldiers. Although, submarine crew&#8217;s rules on personal grooming are a little more lax. At the bear minimum they don&#8217;t have to shave everyday. And considering they&#8217;re stuck in a metal tube for months at a time, it&#8217;s not too surprising they get some leeway.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Haircuts.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Looking For Leaks</h2>\n<p>When you&#8217;re submerged on a submarine you&#8217;re going to spend a lot of time looking for leaks in the hull. If a normal boat has a hole in the hull, it&#8217;ll just start to slowly sink. On a submarine though, submerged underwater, small leaks can become big problems in a matter of moments due to the increased pressure. So finding and fixing them as quickly as possible would save the crew&#8217;s life.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Leaks.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Cramped Hallways</h2>\n<p>Considering the size and shape of a submarine, it&#8217;s probably obvious that the hallways are cramped. They&#8217;re so narrow that only one person can walk through at a time. So you probably won&#8217;t be able to pass by a crew mate if you&#8217;re trying to goin the opposite direction.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Hallway.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Shower Size</h2>\n<p>Remember how cramped the hallways are? Well, the showers are pretty cramped too. They&#8217;re not only out in the open like other military bathing centers, but the area they&#8217;re in is incredibly small. Despite being surrounded by it, the usable water for showers is also pretty limited.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Shower.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Kitchen Size</h2>\n<p>The kitchen on a submarine is called a galley. And in comparison to everything else on the sub, the galley&#8217;s actually a lot bigger than you&#8217;d expect. They&#8217;re still small though. It is where the food is prepared after all, and you&#8217;re going to need some extra space for that.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Kitchen.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Food Supply</h2>\n<p>Submarines need to stay submerged for months, so resupplying isn&#8217;t an option a lot of the time when they need more food. Fresh food also only lasts a couple of weeks. The chefs onboard are capable of using some dried foods to great effect though. They can even make dishes as complicated as lasagna. They also use as many tricks to increase the shelf life of certain foods. Fortunately, because of the colder temperature underwater, foods last longer on average.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Food.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Command Launch</h2>\n<p>Command launch is where the submarine is intended to store their weapons, such as the earlier mentioned missiles. The command launch not only stores their weaponry, but is also where the officers and other crew members work. The limited space actually allows for specific design features to make it easier to work in.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Command-Launcg.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>&#8220;Crossing The Line&#8221;</h2>\n<p>Sailors have many superstitions and ceremonies and submariners are no different. One ceremony they have is the &#8220;Line-Crossing Ceremony&#8221;. The ceremony is when they cross over the Equator. Those who have done it before are called &#8220;shellbacks&#8221;. Any one being initiated are called &#8220;pollywogs&#8221;, or &#8220;wogs&#8221; for short.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Crossing-the-Line.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Doing Laundry</h2>\n<p>On a submarine, there is normally only one washing machine and one dryer. And they&#8217;re not exactly that large, so they can only handle so much laundry at once. Although, they&#8217;re not much different from the ones you have at home. They&#8217;re just shared between 100 different people.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Washing-Machine.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Unique Uniforms</h2>\n<p>Submariners have a uniform, like other members of the navy, but theirs are a bit different. The overalls they wear are made of lint-free polyester. This is to avoid any lint potentially clogging the air filtration system onboard. The uniform also has a funny nickname; the poopie suit.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Uniforms.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Getting Rid Of Trash</h2>\n<p>Even within the cramped quarters of a submarine, there are still 100 people on one. And that means that there&#8217;s a lot of trash produced by all those people. Since it can&#8217;t exactly just be tossed out, some trash is simply sorted until it can be unloaded and recycle onshore. What can&#8217;t be recycled is sealed in a special steel can and dumped into the ocean.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Trash.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Medical Treatment</h2>\n<p>And, as all ships do, a submarine has a medical practitioner. Although they&#8217;re referred to as such onboard, they&#8217;re not technically doctors. Although they do undergo a rigorous, medical training process. They make sure the crew stays healthy, treating both major and minor injuries. They can often even perform surgeries if necessary.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Submarine-Doctor.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Taking Hard Turns</h2>\n<p>Most of the time, moving below the waves, it&#8217;s pretty calm and motionless to be traveling in a sub. But sometimes it needs to make a few hard turns. They&#8217;re called &#8220;angles and dangles&#8221;. Normally these are just tests done to see how the crew deals with extreme ceremonies. Dealing with this normally just involves grabbing onto what you can and making sure the equipment is properly secured.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hard-Turns.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Do All The Drills</h2>\n<p>There are all kinds of drills when working on a submarine. The most important of them are fire, flooding, and reactor drills. And there are also different drills for various battle scenarios. Even when docking at port, the crew will need to carry out drills. One important drill is a &#8220;hot run&#8221;. The scenario for that one is that a torpedo accidentally went off in the submarine.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Safety-Drills.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n",

"rendered": "<p>Sometimes when you renovating your home, you might find something interesting or unexpected. Sometimes it&#8217;s cool, other times it&#8217;s strange. And sometimes you may need to remove or take care of whatever that thing is, no matter how long you&#8217;ve lived in the house. But other times, the thing you find is just plane strange. And here are a few examples of that.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Hidden Room</h2>\n<p>That&#8217;s an interesting way to find out your house had a hidden room. This guy found his after he parked a bus where it was located. Unfortunately, now he also has to get it repaired. Turns out the structure couldn&#8217;t handle the weight of a bus.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Hidden-Room.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Hedgehog Door</h2>\n<p>Making a doggie door is one thing, but a hedgehog door? Maybe the regular flap just wasn&#8217;t enough. The previous owner of this house probably felt as though it was more of a necessity.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hedgehod-Door.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Hello Bricks!</h2>\n<p>These bricks are over 100 years old. Turns out they were behind the plaster that had been put up. It&#8217;s certainly cool, but the bricks don&#8217;t really seem to fit the aesthetic of the house anymore.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bricks.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Anyone Thirsty?</h2>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t actually a bad house design, just very unusual. Especially considering the fact that the house should have sinks for tap water. But hey, some people just enjoy drinking from water fountains more than anything. It would really give off those public school vibes everyone was missing while quarantining.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Drinking-Fountain.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>No Front Door</h2>\n<p>This really does seem like a major design flaw. Hopefully there&#8217;s a back door or some kind of side entrance. It seems like it&#8217;d get annoying very fast to enter or exit your house through the window every day.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Front-Door.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>An Interesting Place For A Toilet</h2>\n<p>A reoccurring trend in a lot of strange houses is strange locations for the toilet. For example, this one&#8217;s right at the top of the basement stairs. And it&#8217;s fully functional! Good for emergencies, but it does make it a bit harder to get out of the basement.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Toilet.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Double The Toilets</h2>\n<p>Now, whether or not both of these toilets are functional hasn&#8217;t been confirmed, but they&#8217;re certainly both bolted to the ground. And they&#8217;re both facing each other. At least with that table you can play some boardgames together.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Two-Toilets.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Staircase To Nowhere</h2>\n<p>Well, it might make for a good storage area. But really, what is the point of this area and staircase? It just heads nowhere. Was this built just to trick people?</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Staircase-to-Nowhere.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Carpet Above The Door</h2>\n<p>Maybe there used to be more floor in this area, but it&#8217;s gone now. There&#8217;s just a strip with a fully carpeted floor. But from no point in the house is it at all accessible.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Carpet-above-the-Door.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Second Secret Door</h2>\n<p>One secret door is crazy enough, but apparently this is the second one this person found in their new house. Hidden right behind a bookshelf.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Secret-Door.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>What In The Box?</h2>\n<p>You may find strange boxes or safes in your house, but this one really takes the cake. Why you might ask? Apparently there&#8217;s something inside. It&#8217;s banging around in there, trying to get out.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Whats-in-the-Box.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Monopoly House</h2>\n<p>Do you like Monopoly? Well, hopefully the owner of this house likes it. All they need is a bunch of giant-sized Monopoly tokens and they can play on the floor. Plus maybe something to clean up the floor.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Monopoly-Board.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Gravestone House</h2>\n<p>Many houses are made from stone and brick. Sometimes houses are made using preexisting materials. But in this case, the house was made from a particularly dark origin. That being the house being made from gravestones. They still have the names carved onto them and everything.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gravestones.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Electric Safe</h2>\n<p>Behind a fake electrical socket is a pretty good place to hide a safe. At least until someone tries to use it. And that&#8217;s how this person ended up finding a small safe in their new house.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Eletrical-Safe.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Samurai Sword</h2>\n<p>A lot of these interesting things are built into the house, but sometimes you just find an interesting relic that was left behind. This house is 100 years old and the person renovating it found a samurai sword.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Samurai-Sword.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Soap From Yugoslavia</h2>\n<p>How old is this house that you found this soap from Yugoslavia? You may not know how interesting this find is if you&#8217;re unfamiliar with global geography. Yugoslavia broke up in 1992.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Soap.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>House Number</h2>\n<p>This is a really interesting find. During a certain time of the year, because of etched glass on the door, the house&#8217;s number is projected onto the stairs.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/House-Number.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Chain Within The Wall</h2>\n<p>This home was built in the 1930s and has been renovated since then. However, that doesn&#8217;t answer the question of what this chain&#8217;s for. It&#8217;s not really hurting anyone, but that chain behind the wall isn&#8217;t doing anything helpful either.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Chain.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A House Within A House</h2>\n<p>Kids love having their own playhouses when they&#8217;re still little. Well, the previous owner of this house decided to do that for their kids. And it just so happens to be fully functional, with electricity and everything. And they left it behind for the next family that moved in to have fun with it.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Another-House.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Nest Of Bowling Balls</h2>\n<p>Imagine beginning renovations on your new house. You tear up some boards or something else outside your house, and find 150 bowling balls buried in the dirt. It&#8217;s certainly a strange sight to behold. But at least you can bring your own balls when you go bowling now.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bowling-Balls.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Well, Looky Here</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s actually been similar events to this in houses around the world. You pull up a couple of floorboard and boom! You realize you have a well in your house. It&#8217;s a fun thing to show off, but make sure not to put anything heavy over the covering.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Well.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Tapes From David Koresh</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re unaware of who David Koresh is, he&#8217;s a cult leader that was in charge of the Branch Dividians. Someone found these tapes in their new house. And 1993 was the same year as the Waco Siege that led to a fire in the Branch Dividians base of operations.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/David-Koresh.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Raven In The Attic</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s like something out of an Edgar Allen Poe story. This homeowner headed into their attic to find a live crow inside. It&#8217;s an eerie sight to say the least.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Raven.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Coffin With A View</h2>\n<p>Imagine dying and being buried. But because they still want you to be able to see out of your coffin, they add a little viewport for you. Now imagine you&#8217;re the person that accidentally digs up this coffin on your property.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Coffin.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Some Documents From The CIA</h2>\n<p>This may very well be the most dangerous or important thing you could find in your house. Who were the previous owners of your house if you find CIA documents inside of it?</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/CIA.webp'/></figure></p>\n",

But this story isn&#8217;t about a happy wedding. It&#8217;s a revenge tale. One about why you should never cheat. Because the revenge will always come when you least expect it.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Susan And Alex</h2>\n<p>Susan and Alex had been dating for six years.  Things seemed to be going well. So well in fact that Alex popped the big question. And Susan said yes without hesitation. And they immediately began to plan for the big day. Although, things weren&#8217;t going to end up happily ever after.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Meet-Cute.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Everything&#8217;s Perfect</h2>\n<p>As time went on, their love only seemed to get stronger. And their friends and family were certain that they would spend the rest of their lives together. Their parents had become friends and their most cynical acquaintances believed that that their love was one for the ages.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Perfect-Couple.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Last Day</h2>\n<p>Eventually, everything for their wedding was budgeted and planned accordingly. They just needed to kick back and relax. As such, they began planning for their respective bachelorette and bachelor parties. They needed to celebrate their last nights of &#8220;singlehood&#8221;.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bachelorette-Party.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Love And Loyalty</h2>\n<p>The two of them really seemed as though they were on the path for a life of love and loyalty to one another. And it was their last night before they&#8217;d be spending their lives in heavenly matrimony. They were going to have fun, but not too much fun&#8230;</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Loving-Couple.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Nervous Bride</h2>\n<p>Despite all the fun she was having with her girls, it had finally hit Susan. This would be her last night being single, at least legally speaking. She suddenly started to get nervous about the whole thing.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Nervous-Bride.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Bachelorette Party</h2>\n<p>Fortunately, Susan spending time with her friends helped her wind down a little. She was able to enjoy herself once again. But after all was said in done, she told her friends that she wanted to return to her hotel room and rest for the remainder of the night.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Bachelorette.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Mysterious Message</h2>\n<p>As her friends were getting ready to head to bed, Susan&#8217;s phone suddenly went off. Curious as to why it would be going off at this hour, she checked the notification. And she was at a loss for what it was. It was a series of photos of Alex in bed with another woman!</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mysterious-Message.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>At A Loss For Words</h2>\n<p>It took her some time to realize what she was looking at. But when she finally realized, she was absolutely shocked. There was no name attached to the number, it was completely anonymous. And then another message came in: &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t marry him. Will you?&#8221;</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Shocked-Woman.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Overwhelmed With Emotion</h2>\n<p>Susan became overwhelmed upon the realization. Her friends could instantly tell something was wrong and did their best to comfort her. While they tried to reassure her that they would get even, all Susan could really do was sit there in silence.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Crying-Woman.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>What To Do</h2>\n<p>Eventually, Susan got a hold of herself. She was still sad, but at least she had stopped crying. She had no idea what to do next. The wedding was the next day and she had just found out her fiancé was cheating on her. She and her friends started to brainstorm what their next move should be.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Sad-and-Confused.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Call It Off?</h2>\n<p>Considering how much money they had already spent on the wedding, it was the worst time to get this news. The most logical option was still to cancel the wedding. At least that&#8217;s what the bridesmaids said. But they also weren&#8217;t the ones getting married to Alex. Susan had her own feelings about the matter, but was still unsure of how to proceed.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Cancelled-Wedding.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>She Couldn&#8217;t Sleep</h2>\n<p>Susan&#8217;s friends gave her some space to collect her thoughts. She had trouble sleeping, unable to get a wink. She couldn&#8217;t stop looking at the messages and photos that the anonymous person had given her. And they gave her a detailed image of what Alex was doing behind her back.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Insomniac-Women.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Tough Decision</h2>\n<p>The morning came, and it was still time to get ready for the wedding. Susan hadn&#8217;t gotten a wink of sleep and was still wondering what to do about her relationship. Was she just going to suck it up and marry Alex? Or was she going to do something a little more drastic?</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tough-Decision.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Time To Prepare</h2>\n<p>The bridesmaids didn&#8217;t know that Susan was already up, preparing for the wedding. Her dress and jewelry was on, she just needed to get her makeup ready. And that&#8217;s when Susan had the most devious idea. She was going to get her revenge after all.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wedding-Prep.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Ready To Go</h2>\n<p>Looking at herself in the mirror, Susan knew that Alex had made a major mistake. The bridesmaids had no idea what was going on and assumed she was just going through with the wedding. And while they were concerned, Susan assured them that she had everything well under control.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ready-Bride.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Gorgeous Day</h2>\n<p>Funnily enough, the weather was gorgeous on her wedding day. The sun was out and there wasn&#8217;t a cloud in sight. All of her friends and family had massive smiles on their faces, prepared for the joyous occasion. They couldn&#8217;t wait to have fun at the reception. Although, Susan obviously had something else in mind.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Good-Weather.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>All According To Plan</h2>\n<p>Susan knew what she wanted to happen, but she had to be patient. It would feel like an eternity until the moment would be right. She was anxious and restless, pacing back and forth, but also trying to still appear normal. But eventually, the ceremony finally began.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Scheming-Bride.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Going Down The Aisle</h2>\n<p>Alex arrived at the ceremony hall and Susan was walked down the aisle. She looked absolutely stunning. All the guests thought that Alex was a lucky man. Not too long after, they began reading their vows.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Down-the-Aisle.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Reciting Their Vows</h2>\n<p>Alex went first, but found himself a little distracted. At first, Susan kept her veil on. But it was soon revealed that she was crying. Alex tried to comfort her and reassure her, but soon began reading his vows.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Vows.png'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>In Front Of Everyone</h2>\n<p>After saying his vows, and seemingly meaning every word of it, it was Susan&#8217;s turn. And she felt sick to her stomach. But she stuck to guns and began to enact her plan.

Instead, she took out her and began reading off the messages and showing the pictures she received last night. Finally she said the definitive words; &#8220;There will be no wedding today&#8221;.

But sometimes you may end up finding something a little bit more exceptional. Here are some of the most interesting discoveries found in the world.</p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">The Underground Pyramid In Bolivia</h2>\n<p>Tiahuanaco, Bolivia is a place where there have been quite a few archaeological finds, including ruins. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that this particular structure was expected to be found there. And that would be an underground pyramid. Most of it hasn&#8217;t been excavated yet. People only know it&#8217;s a pyramid because of a ground-penetrating radar. They&#8217;ve also found monoliths within the structure.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Pyramid-in-Bolivia.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">A River Found In The Ocean</h2>\n<p>Would you ever expect to find a river in the ocean? Divers found such a thing underneath a cloud of toxic gas off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. The source of the river is the Cenote Angelita, a massive sinkhole. 90 feet beneath the surface, the river flows out to the ocean. It&#8217;s surrounded by a blanket of hydrogen sulfide and is surrounded by petrified trees an a small skeleton. Ancient Mayans even believed that this might have been a gateway to hell. There are similar &#8220;bodies of water&#8221; like this around the world called brine lakes, but those are due to a high concentration of salt.</p>\n</header>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Underwater-River.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Ship Found In The Namibian Desert</h2>\n<p>How many people would think to look for a ship in the desert? Well, the <em>Bom Jesus </em>was a Portuguese vessel that went missing off the coast of Namibia 500 years ago. And it ended up being discovered in 2008 in the Namibian Desert. It was found by diamond miners in the town Oranjemund who soon alerted the Namibian government. The loud the ship had been carrying included 2,000 gold coins and tens of thousands of pounds of copper ingots, almost completely intact. The cost of the treasure onboard is estimated to be around $13 million.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Namibian-Desert.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Underground Theater In The Paris Catacombs</h2>\n<p>The Paris Catacombs is a labyrinth, built by the city as a better location to store the dead. They began placing bodies there in the late 1700s. While they had been explored before, in 2004 Parisian police discovered something interesting during a training exercise. And that would be a fully-equipped movie theater in the catacombs. Terraces were cut into rock to form an amphitheater, it had a full-sized scree, and a variety of thrillers and noir films were found. It seemed as though someone had just wanted to create their own, private theater but it had become lost to time. Or just lost in general.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Underground-Paris-Theater.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Ancient Chapel Under The House</h2>\n<p>In 2010, in Shropshire, England, on Good Friday, Pat and Diane Farla found this in their house. That being an ancient chapel behind a six-foot plate on their wall. It was cellar-like in its size and design, but came complete with pews and a cross. The belief was that the church was used by congregations fleeing religious persecution centuries ago during one of England&#8217;s religious wars.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hidden-Chapel.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Viking Ship Buried In A Farm</h2>\n<p>Ground-penetrating radar has turned out to be a pretty useful archaeological tool. In Edoy, Norway, people were able to find ship buried beneath the ground. It was either from the Merovingian or Viking Period. Despite only being buried two feet below the surface, it wasn&#8217;t found until 2019. The archaeological team was there for a completely different expedition too. It had been a part of a burial mound 1000 years ago.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Viking-Ship.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Qing-Dynasty Vase Found In An Attic</h2>\n<p>Sometimes when you get a new house, you can go through the attic and find new and interesting items. Such as a beautiful, porcelain vase. And sometimes, when you take that vase to get appraised, you find out it&#8217;s worth at least $590,000 and from Qing Dynasty China. It&#8217;s unclear how it had gotten there, but the couple that bought the house probably didn&#8217;t mind. And it was sold at an auction $19 million.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Qing-Dynasty-Vase.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Painting In The Walls</h2>\n<p>After their father had died, two brothers began going through their father&#8217;s home. And that&#8217;s when they discovered something interesting in the walls. It was an original Normal Rockwell painting. Funnily enough, it matched the painting hanging on the wall just a few inches away. Their father was actually hiding the original from his ex-wife during their divorce. The painting was called <em>Breaking Home Ties</em> and sold for $15.4 million at auction.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Found-Painting.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>An Original Mark Twain Script Found In A Trunk</h2>\n<p>Considering how hard it can be to find old manuscripts and papers, since they often disintegrate with time, finding a Mark Twain manuscript is very impressive. It was the original 665-page document of <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>. It was widely different from the final product as well. People had assumed it would never be found, since it disappeared in Buffalo, New York. But it was found in 1991 in a trunk in Hollywood by the granddaughter of one of Twain&#8217;s close friends.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mark-Twain-Script.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>World War II Plane Found In The Jungle</h2>\n<p>Known as the &#8220;Swamp Ghost&#8221;, it was a Boeing B-17E bomber that had been used in World War II. It went down in 1942 in the jungles of Papua New Guinea during a raid on Japanese forces in Rabaul, New Britain. It was untouched for decades, until it was found in 1972. It was so well preserved that they even found coffee still inside the thermoses in the cockpit. A well-preserved plane like this is believed to go for around $9 million.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/WWII-Plane-in-Jungle.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<header class=\"entry-header\">\n<h2 class=\"entry-title\">The Antikythera Mechanism</h2>\n</header>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">The Antikythera Mechanism is, expectedly, named after the location it was found in, Antikythera, Greece. It&#8217;s a two thousand year old astronomical calculator that consists of thirty hand-cut, precise, bronze gears. It&#8217;s a priceless item that has taken scientists years to figure out how it works. It was discovered in 1900 by sponge divers in an ancient shipwreck and was dated to have been created around 65 BC.</div>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/The-Antikythera-Mechanism.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Mummy In A Statue</h2>\n<p>Finding a thousand-year-old Buddha statue is impressive enough on its own. But finding out there might be something inside would be an even greater surprise. Historians wanted to return the statue to its former glory and started running tests on it. One of these included an X-ray to see what it was made of. And that&#8217;s when the scientists found a human skeleton. It wasn&#8217;t actually a statue after all, it was a sarcophagus. As such, the scientists decided to just leave the person inside where they were.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Mummy-in-Buddha-Statue.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Burger King Behind A Wall</h2>\n<p>The Concord Mall is the oldest wall in Delaware, having had a number of restaurants, attractions, and shops come and go over the years. The mall had opened up a Burger King in the 1980s, but it had been shut down in 2009. However, it hadn&#8217;t been torn down. In the summer of 2022, someone accidentally broke through one of the walls to find the Burger King franchise, perfectly preserved in all its vintage glory.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Burger-King-Behind-Wall.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Third Century Home Underneath The Streets Of Rome</h2>\n<p>Excavators in 2017 were trying to find a good location to start a new metro line underneath Rome. Of course, the most famous archaeological finds are made by accident. Considering the fact that Rome is one of the oldest, major cities in the world, this should be even less surprising. They had actually found the ruins of a fancy, Third Century home that had been destroyed in a fire. As well as the skeleton of a dog that was 1,800 years old. The home was believed to have been owned by aristocrat Celian Hill.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/3rd-Century-Rome-Home.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Preserved 1961 Fallout Shelter</h2>\n<p>The nuclear panic was really rampant in the 1960s. The Cold War had everyone on edge, so building a fallout shelter wasn&#8217;t the most out of the ordinary thing you could do. But flashing forward to 2013, we see what became of one of those shelters. A couple had found one in their new home. It had been perfectly preserved, acting as a sort of time capsule to the 60s.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Fallout-Shelter.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Roman Coins Found In A Japanese Castle Ruins</h2>\n<p>Katsuren Castle was an old, imperial building in Okinawa, Japan. Considering Japan&#8217;s former isolationist policy (and its status as an island), it would be expected they would&#8217;ve had little contact with most of Europe during the early years of the current era. Which is why it&#8217;s even more surprising that Roman and Ottoman coins were found there in 2016. There were other items found in the excavation of the castle, but this was certainly the most surprising. People are still uncertain of how they could&#8217;ve gotten there.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roman-Coins.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>The Largest Diamond In The United States</h2>\n<p>Most people think of African diamond mining when they might think of the origin of these crystals. But some have been found in America as well. Such as Uncle Sam. That&#8217;s the name of the Arkansas diamond found during a digging operation. It&#8217;s the largest diamond ever found in the United States. It was named Uncle Sam and sold to a dealer in Boston for $150,000 in 1971.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Uncle-Sam-Diamond.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Sprawling Tunnel System Under A Man&#8217;s House</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of different things you can find underground. This list has proven that. But there&#8217;s a difference between archaeological finds and an entire tunnel system. A homeowner in Southern Italy had purchased a six-bedroom house in 2020. While there were tunnels listed as part of the property, they were labeled as being for storage. But when the purchaser got to see how deep the tunnels went, he was pretty surprised. As it turned out, the tunnel system was so deep and large that much it had become infested with bats.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Secret-Tunnel.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Reservoir Of Water On Mars</h2>\n<p>Water can sometimes be found in unexpected places. But no place is more unexpected to find liquid water in than on another planet. Technically, Mars is the only other celestial body in our solar system that has H2O, but it&#8217;s frozen for a majority of the year on Mars&#8217; poles. But in 2021, a Chinese probe called Zhurong had landed at Utopia Planitia, a plan in the northern hemisphere of Mars. It was the same spot that a the Viking 2 NASA lander had arrived at in 1976. Its goal was to find life on other planets. While it hasn&#8217;t yet, it found wet minerals in the Utopia Planitia Basin, indicating that it had recently been filled with water.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Water-on-Mars.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Copy Of The Declaration Of Independence</h2>\n<p>There are a lot of different things you can find in a thrift store. And sometimes you can get something that&#8217;s worth a lot of money. For example, a copy of the Declaration of Independence. Technically, they had bought a painting for $4 because they liked the frame on the painting. And when they took it out, they discovered the copy. And it was a real one too. Meaning that it was one of the first printings of the historical document. It went up for auction in 1991 and was sold for $1 million.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Declaration-of-Independence.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>A Medieval Well Under Their Living Room Floor</h2>\n<p>A couple in Plymouth, England was trying to discover why their living room wasn&#8217;t level. And that led to this discovery. Turns out there was a 30-foot medieval well beneath the floorboards. Some research revealed that the well was built in the 1500s as part of an aqueduct. Sir Francis Drake had it built in order to carry water from Plymouth to Dartmouth. They&#8217;ve since covered it with a trapdoor and installed lights to show it off.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Medieval-Well.webp'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Stonehenge At The Bottom Of Lake Michigan</h2>\n<p>When looking underneath the waters of Lake Michigan, archaeologists found something incredibly eerie. There was a Stonehenge-like structure 40 feet below the surface of Grand Traverse Bay. People don&#8217;t know why Stonehenge was built, but it can at least be seen that the sun shines in this specific location through Stonehenge at one day of the year. As for why this would be built underwater, that&#8217;s even more of a mystery. There was also a pier from the Civil War found, with quite a few sunken cars and boats.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Stonehedge-Lake-Michigan.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Nanotechnology In A Roman Chalice</h2>\n<p>This Roman chalice was already worth a lot on its own. It&#8217;s called the Lycurgus Cup, as the scene it pictures involves Thrace&#8217;s King Lycurgus. When the cup&#8217;s lit up from the front, it looks jade green. And when it&#8217;s lit up from behind it turns red. It was discovered in the 1950s, but took until the 90s for them to figure out how this worked. As it turns out, the Romans may have been pioneers in nanotechnology, as they had used certain precious metal to alter the cup&#8217;s electrons.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Roman-Chalice.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Gold Sovereign Coins In A Piano</h2>\n<p>Bishops Castle Community College had an old piano they needed to have repaired. And when the tuner in question took the piano apart, he discovered a hoard of British, gold coins. The former owner of the gold had hidden it inside the piano and never returned for them. The Coroner&#8217;s Court of Shrewsbury declared the find &#8220;treasure&#8221;, so the college and tuner were allowed to split the proceeds. There were 913 gold coins, dated between 1847 and 1915. Their total value ended up being between $400,000 and $600,000.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Gold-Sovreign-Coins.jpg'/></figure></p>\n<p><!--nextpage--></p>\n<h2>Tombstones Washed Up At Ocean Beach</h2>\n<p>In 20212, a pair of beachgoers discovered a strange stone had washed up on the shore of Ocean Beach in San Francisco. As it turned out, it was the tombstone of a 20-year-old Emma Bosworth who had died in 1876. From that point on, they started to find additional tombstones, washing up at different points. This had happened because San Francisco had opted to move cemeteries within city limits to Colma, California. And during the move, the tombstones were left behind and repurposed into.a sea wall. And when those pieces broke off, they ended up washing back ashore to Ocean Beach.</p>\n<p><figure><img src='https://www.thedelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Tombstones-at-Ocean-Beach.jpeg'/></figure></p>\n",
